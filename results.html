            A paragraph is a self-contained unit of 
            discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea. 
            A paragraph consists of one or more sentences. 
            Though not required by the syntax of any language, 
            paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer prose.</p>
